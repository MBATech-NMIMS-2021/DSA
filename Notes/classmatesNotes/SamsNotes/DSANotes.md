Types of linear data structures

- Arrays
- Stacks

### Arrays

---

- Elements arranged in continuos memory.
- All elements are of the same type.

---

### Stacks

---

#### Applications

---

##### In compilers

- Compilers use stacks to figure out the value of expressions like `2 + 4 / 5 * (7 - 9)`

---

##### In browsers

---

- The back button saves all URL's we've visited in a stack.
