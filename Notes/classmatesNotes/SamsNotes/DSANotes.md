---

-   A data structure is a particular way of organizing data in the computer so that it can be used effectively.

---

## Types of data structures

---

1. Linear data structure
2. Non linear data structures

---

## Linear data structure

---

-   Elements arranged in a sequence, one after the other.

Types of linear data structures

-   Arrays
-   Stacks
-   Queues
-   Linked lists

---

### Arrays

---

-   Elements arranged in continuos memory.
-   All elements are of the same type.

---

### Stacks

---

#### Applications

---

##### In compilers

---

-   Compilers use stacks to figure out the value of expressions like `2 + 4 / 5 * (7 - 9)`

---

##### In browsers

---

-   The back button saves all URL's we've visited in a stack.

---

-   The last element that gets into the stack is removed first (**LIFO Principle**: Last in first out)

---

#### Terminologies

---

##### Push

---

-   To put the element inside the stack.

---

##### Pop

---

-   To remove an element from the stack. (Which is the last, recently inserted element)

---

##### Top

---

-   A variable to store the index value of the topmost element.

---

### Queues

---

![Queues image](../../../images/queue.png)

---

-   Works on the principle of first in first out (**FIFO**)
-   So the first element that gets inside also becomes the first element to leave the queue.

---

#### Applications

---

##### Call centers

---

- To hold people calling them in order, until a service representative is free.

---

##### CPU task processing

---

- Serving request on a single shared resource like printer, CPU task scheduling.

### Linked list

---

- Elements not stored in contiguous memory locations.
- Elements linked using pointers
