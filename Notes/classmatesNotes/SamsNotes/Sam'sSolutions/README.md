- This folder contains the solutions to the [Experiments of DSA](./Experiments/), of [Sam Varghese](https://www.linkedin.com/in/sam-varghese-1a7701209/).
- The format in which solution files have been names is `Exp<exp no.>Q<que. no>`
- **Note**: The main motive of putting the solutions of experiments on github is only to keep record of all the things I'm learning in DSA, at [NMIMS, Indore](https://nmims.edu).
- Folks who're here, are requested not to copy and paste the codes directly, else you'll face difficulty in this subject, and computer science in general.
